# Research

The rapid nascence of data availability, powerful algorithms, and quantitative methodology are necessitating novel conceptualisations of „digital“, serving both as an applied means of constructing information and as an arena for critical inquiry into emergent modes of representation. With a broad focus on the interplays between human health and social/built/natural environments, the Digital Health Geographies Research Group explores the confluence of applied machine learning and the analysis of situated, community-scale sociocultural practice through empirical study.

Here are some themes and techniques that we currently work on:

**COVID-19** ***Can artificial intelligence algorithms identify community-scale socioeconomic and built-environment risk factors?***
The project examines geographical associations between COVID-19, socioeconomic status, and the built/natural environment. Using contemporary spatial epidemiological techniques and Bayesian machine learning we are presently testing novel methodological combinations to triangulate factors underlying the spatial and temporal structures of the epidemic in Germany.
In recent years artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms have raised attention and critique. These so-called “black-box” models yield impressive predictive performance when analysing high-dimensional, complex datasets, but at the cost of interpretability. Using COVID-19 in Germany as an example, the Digital Health Geographies Research Group seeks to explore ways to open up these “black boxes” and dissect their algorithms, with the ultimate goal of developing methods for implementing prior geographical knowledge in machine learning.

**VIBRANCE** ***Violência no Brasil: análise de comunidades e espaço / Violence in Brazil: Analysis of Community Environments*** 
Brazil is known worldwide for its vibrant cultural diversity and beautiful landscapes. However, increasing awareness of deeply embedded  social issues such as social inequality, poverty, and violence underscores the need for more nuanced understandings of their interrelations with space and place. VIBRANCE is a collaborative study bringing together researchers from Brazil, Germany, and Canada to develop and implement innovative interdisciplinary approaches to studying space, place, and violence. By using advanced quantitative techniques and situated qualitative inquiry, VIBRANCE assesses various domains of social and spatial risk factors of violence at multiple scales across the country, seeking to advance understandings of the complex geographies of violence and to identify policies and programmes to reduce the burden of violence in Brazilian communities.

**COVID-19 Narratives** ***How do (un)informed discourses about pandemics and space develop and (d)evolve through digital (social)media?***
Using COVID-19 as an example, the Digital Health Geographies research group uses automated knowledge mining methods to investigate, on the basis of different types of text, (1) which spatial-cognitive strategies are used to consistently locate crises outside one’s living environment, (2) which events modify these narratives over time, and (3) how newly emerging arguments discursively re-bind these events. The aim of the study is to alleviate the socioeconomic consequences of crises by revealing the suspensive character of certain narratives for necessary political decision-making processes.

**PURE SPACE** ***Prospective Urban and Rural Epidemiology: Spatial Analysis of Cardiovascular Environments***
This project seeks to disentangle the complex relationships between socioeconomic status, the built/natural environment, and chronic diseases, specifically focussing on cardiovascular disease and diabetes mellitus risk factors. Using epidemiological techniques and machine learning, we develop socioeconomic and environmental indices to estimate the spatial component of CVD risk. This project is being conducted as part of the [https://www.phri.ca/research/pure/](Prospective Urban and Rural Epidemiology) (PURE) Study.

**STAGE** ***Spatial Transcoding of Artificial Geographical Environments***
In the field of Place Research, visual spaces, both real-world and artificial, provide a stage for shared social practice. There exist different forms of visual spaces, ranging from complete virtual worlds over augmented reality to geoservices, which add digital information on site.
Individual practice is bound to the participant’s specific experiences and cultural context. As it can be revealed by the metaphor of game and play, we explore how these aspects are represented, expressed, and enacted in different game environments. Derived questions cover: How is space used as an element within the game to create a flow state, which binds the player to the game?

**GEM** ***In what ways does greenspace influence human health?***
Urban greenspaces such as parks, trees, gardens, or green roofs may have a positive effect on physical and mental health. However, the pathways concerning how greenspaces promote health are often complex. For example, higher availability of vegetation contributes to improved air quality and reduces the effects of urban heat islands, access to public parks can provide opportunities for exercise and community building, and higher visible greenness in daily life may reduce stress and anxiety.
By 2030, 60% of the worlds population will be living in urban environments and even though greenspaces have the potential to buffer the adverse health effects of urban living, studies suggest that this potential often remains underutilised. It is thus important to understand the different types of greenspace exposure (e.g. Accessibility, Availability, and Visibility of Greenspace) and their underlying pathways to assist decision makers and urban designers in their efforts to build healthy and sustainable cities.
In this project we investigate these complex relationships and effects on human health by building spatial algorithms to improve Greenspace Exposure Modeling.
