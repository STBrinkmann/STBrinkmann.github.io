***Spatial Transcoding of Artificial Geographical Environments***<br>
</span>
In the field of Place Research, visual spaces, both real-world and artificial, provide a stage for shared social practice. There exist different forms of visual spaces, ranging from complete virtual worlds over augmented reality to geoservices, which add digital information on site.<br>
Individual practice is bound to the participantâ€™s specific experiences and cultural context. As it can be revealed by the metaphor of game and play, we explore how these aspects are represented, expressed, and enacted in different game environments. Derived questions cover: How is space used as an element within the game to create a flow state, which binds the player to the game?
