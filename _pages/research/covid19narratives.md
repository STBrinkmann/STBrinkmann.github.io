## COVID-19 Narratives
***How do (un)informed discourses about pandemics and space develop and (d)evolve through digital (social)media?***<br>
Using COVID-19 as an example, the Digital Health Geographies research group uses automated knowledge mining methods to investigate, on the basis of different types of text, (1) which spatial-cognitive strategies are used to consistently locate crises outside oneâ€™s living environment, (2) which events modify these narratives over time, and (3) how newly emerging arguments discursively re-bind these events. The aim of the study is to alleviate the socioeconomic consequences of crises by revealing the suspensive character of certain narratives for necessary political decision-making processes.
