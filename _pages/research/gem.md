***Greenspace Exposure Modeling: In what ways does greenspace influence human health?***<br>
Urban greenspaces such as parks, trees, gardens, or green roofs may have a positive effect on physical and mental health. However, the pathways concerning how greenspaces promote health are often complex. For example, higher availability of vegetation contributes to improved air quality and reduces the effects of urban heat islands, access to public parks can provide opportunities for exercise and community building, and higher visible greenness in daily life may reduce stress and anxiety.<br>
By 2030, 60% of the worlds population will be living in urban environments and even though greenspaces have the potential to buffer the adverse health effects of urban living, studies suggest that this potential often remains underutilised. It is thus important to understand the different types of greenspace exposure (e.g. Accessibility, Availability, and Visibility of Greenspace) and their underlying pathways to assist decision makers and urban designers in their efforts to build healthy and sustainable cities.<br>
In this project we investigate these complex relationships and effects on human health by building spatial algorithms to improve Greenspace Exposure Modeling.<br>

### GVI: Greenness Visibility Index
	Sebastian Brinkmann provides a tool for 3D modelling of greenness visibility, as seen through the eyes of a pedestrian. Using Digital Elevation Models and Land Cover datasets, the GVI enables detailed analysis of the associations between urban greenspace and mental health. The GVI R package is available for free, non-commercial use at [github.com/STBrinkmann/GVI](github.com/STBrinkmann/GVI).
