The project examines geographical associations between COVID-19, socioeconomic status, and the built/natural environment. Using contemporary spatial epidemiological techniques and Bayesian machine learning we are presently testing novel methodological combinations to triangulate factors underlying the spatial and temporal structures of the epidemic in Germany.<br>
In recent years artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms have raised attention and critique. These so-called “black-box” models yield impressive predictive performance when analysing high-dimensional, complex datasets, but at the cost of interpretability. Using COVID-19 in Germany as an example, the Digital Health Geographies Research Group seeks to explore ways to open up these “black boxes” and dissect their algorithms, with the ultimate goal of developing methods for implementing prior geographical knowledge in machine learning.
