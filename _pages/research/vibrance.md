Brazil is known worldwide for its vibrant cultural diversity and beautiful landscapes. However, increasing awareness of deeply embedded  social issues such as social inequality, poverty, and violence underscores the need for more nuanced understandings of their interrelations with space and place. VIBRANCE is a collaborative study bringing together researchers from Brazil, Germany, and Canada to develop and implement innovative interdisciplinary approaches to studying space, place, and violence. By using advanced quantitative techniques and situated qualitative inquiry, VIBRANCE assesses various domains of social and spatial risk factors of violence at multiple scales across the country, seeking to advance understandings of the complex geographies of violence and to identify policies and programmes to reduce the burden of violence in Brazilian communities.
